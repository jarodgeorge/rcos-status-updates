## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week we talked with Ranjit and create many specific tickets for weekly progress
>I assigned my self to Py-TEST, Securing Postgres servers, and a Travis-CI build
>I created a demo Py-test file and then have been looking to install and set up a postgres
>server

## This Week's Plan

>This week I would like to work with the data pipeline team to post their data to the database

## Anything Blocking?

>The docker still doesn't have all the requirements for last years code, I'm not sure if 
>it will be neccesary though.
