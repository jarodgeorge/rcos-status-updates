## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week I pushed some sample pytest code to the server, and once we
> push other teams code to master I will make a testing suite

## This Week's Plan

>This week I would like to work with the data pipeline team and website team to push some data 
> to a website
## Anything Blocking?

>The docker still doesn't have all the requirements for last years code, I'm not sure if 
>it will be neccesary though. Lots of people so sometimes its hard to share the work

## Notes
