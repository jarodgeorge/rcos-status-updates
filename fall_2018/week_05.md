## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I debugged my docker postgres setup
>I looked over Corey's code to push end of day stock information to the server

## This Week's Plan

>This week I would like to push my own data to the database and make some changes to the d
>pipeline
## Anything Blocking?

>The docker still has some issues where I cannot build all the requirements. I might have
>to use a local postgres server for now

## Notes

> No notes as of now
