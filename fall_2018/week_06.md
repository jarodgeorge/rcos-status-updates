## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I researched a stock graph creation module called Dash
> Created a demo stock graph generator that used yahoo finance direct calls

## This Week's Plan

>Get the graphs working with out database rather than direct calls to yahoo finance
>Organize our team better so we have an update master branch and defined roles goals

## Anything Blocking?

>The front end and datapipeline teams need to push their progress in order for our testing team
> to make more tests and for me to implement my graph feature

## Notes

> No notes as of now
